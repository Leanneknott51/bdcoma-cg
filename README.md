# W3C BD Comics Manga Community Group

This Community Group is open to every person interested in the authoring of digital visual narratives, W3C member or not. 
It does not focus on technology; rather on how different forms of digital works can be modeled in a universal way.  

The draft charter preview can be reviewed [here](https://raw.githack.com/w3c/bdcoma-cg/master/BD%20Comics%20Manga%20Community%20Group%20Charter.htm).

The work is starting, with a focus on different use cases like Webtoon, Turbomedia, digitized works & guided navigation, inbook update etc. and features like scroll, snap-points, transitions, parallax effects etc. 

It is planned to have two calls per month as a start, one optimized for Asia-EU exchanges, the other for USA-EU exchanges. Discussions a manged via a mailing list and  github issues.
